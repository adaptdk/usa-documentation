# Jargon

There is a lot of jargon used in the tech industry. Most of it is harmless, but some of it comes saddled with connotations that we do not support at Adapt. We're not saying that whoever invented these terms / colloquialisms had bad intentions, just that in today's context we don't support them.

Please refer to the following list of words that we frown upon & use the alternatives as much as you can. If you come across a new one, submit a PR to add it to the list!
