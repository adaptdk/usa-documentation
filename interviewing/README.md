# Interviewing

The following can be used as a starting point for interviewing potential hires.
We should strive to get towards some sort of
[structured interview process](https://web.archive.org/web/20200511052822/https://hire.google.com/articles/structured-interview/)

## Culture Fit / Culture Add

These questions are intended to help you get to know a person's motivations and
how they work. Remember that diversity is a strength so evaluating their
answers doesn't come down to, "will I want to get a beer with them?" We want
to know if their goals and working style will align well enough with Adapt's and
the current team to be mutually beneficial.

- Why do you want to work at Adapt?
- Tell me about a past project and your role on that project / within that
  team. Was the project successful? Did you enjoy that role? Do you have
  any takeaways from the project?
  - Follow up: Have you had any projects that haven't gone well? How did you
    navigate what can be a stressful situation and what did you take out of
    that?
- If you were working for Adapt right now and you could set your own schedule,
  how would you prefer to spend your time?
- In 3 - 5 years, what kind of position do you want to be in or what type of
  work do you want to be doing?
- Everyone works different and has different relationships with the people they
  work with.
  - Ideally, how do you want to interact with a manager or team lead?
  - What about with other team members?
- For developers: What kind of tech do you get excited about? Anything that
  you think would be fun to explore if you got a chance on a client project?
- What are you passionate about outside of work?

## Intern Screening

We want to create a space where interns can be productive and learn new skills. In order to do this, we should strive to ensure that interns come in with a minimum baseline of knowledge.

### Example Interview Questions

- Scenario based questions, how would you approach
  - Learning a new technology?
  - Working in a codebase that involves a library that you haven't worked with before?
  - Implementing a feature where the requirements aren't clear to you?
- Tell me about a project that you're proud of. Can you describe the approach that you took from start to finish?
- Pretend I'm a tech novice. Can you describe ... to me:
  - API
  - Front-end VS Back-end
  - How a browser works
- What would you do if in the course of working on a feature you encounter something that you didn't know how to do?

### Coding Challenge

In advance of our first conversation, we should have prospects complete a small coding challenge. The ideal challenge would take no more than one hour.

@TODO: Replace the following section with a link to a repository.

The challenge be structured as follows:

- Set up a public repository under the Adapt namespace
- In the README, document how to complete the challenge
- Candidate forks the repo, completes the challenge and submits a PR back to us for review.
- We can give them a few options of programming languages, JS & PHP to start.
- Each language should have an accompanying test harness + scaffolding to make things easier
  - Ideally this is an empty function / method with a comment letting them know "your code goes here"
  - We aren't trying to ensure we know how to write unit tests, we're trying to ensure they have some basic programming knowledge

- Challenge ideas
  - Write a function to reverse a string
  - Write function to print the odd numbers from 1 to 99
  - Write a function that prints out a breakdown of an integer into a sum of numbers that have just one non-zero digit. For example, given `43018` it should print `40000 + 3000 + 10 + 8`
