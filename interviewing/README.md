Interviewing
------------

The following can be used as a starting point for interviewing potential hires.
We should strive to get towards some sort of
[structured interview process](https://hire.google.com/articles/structured-interview/).


## Culture Fit / Culture Add

These questions are intended to help you get to know a person's motivations and
how they work.  Remember that diversity is a strength so evaluating their
answers doesn't come down to, "will I want to get a beer with them?"  We want
to know if their goals and working style will align well enough with Adapt's and
the current team to be mutually beneficial.

 * Why do you want to work at Adapt?
 * Tell me about a past project and your role on that project / within that
   team.  Was the project successful?  Did you enjoy that role?  Do you have
   any takeaways from the project?
   * Follow up: Have you had any projects that haven't gone well?  How did you
     navigate what can be a stressful situation and what did you take out of
     that?
 * If you were working for Adapt right now and you could set your own schedule,
   how would you prefer to spend your time?
 * In 3 - 5 years, what kind of position do you want to be in or what type of
   work do you want to be doing?
 * Everyone works different and has different relationships with the people they
   work with.
   * Ideally, how do you want to interact with a manager or team lead?
   * What about with other team members?
 * For developers: What kind of tech do you get excited about?  Anything that
   you think would be fun to explore if you got a chance on a client project?
 * What are you passionate about outside of work?
