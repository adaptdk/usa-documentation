# New Contractor Onboarding

- [ ] Ping `@Tommy Davis` in Slack to create an Adapt Email address for the new contractor. We typically use `firstname.lastname@adaptagency.com`, so please provide him with this information. All account access below should use Adapt email address. Github is the exception to this rule, if the contractor has an existing account it's OK to use it.
- [ ] Add new contractor to Github teams
  - https://github.com/orgs/adaptdk/teams/adapt-usa
  - Project specific team(s)
- [ ] Invite to Slack (limit them to project specific channels)
- [ ] Invite to Zenhub (purchase additional seat if needed)
- [ ] Invite to Harvest and assign to appropriate project(s)
- [ ] Invite to Basecamp project
- [ ] Add to any existing standup / meeting invites
- [ ] Schedule on boarding call with project lead
  - Review project goals
  - Review Adapt [workflow norms](../project-workflow/README.md)
- [ ] Assign them a project specific on boarding ticket. These are generic tickets that can be used for every developer on the project in order to get them familiar with the project's environment.
