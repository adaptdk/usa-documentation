# Education Resources

Part of being a good developer is the desire to learn new things. We want to support our staff members in their learning journey as much as possible.

## [Development Library](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SNgViiZ95-csuquivYom340VC38KD6P0?usp=sharing)

We buy books for use by the development team and store them in Google Drive (see link above). These books are available to anyone at Adapt, feel free to download + consume at your leisure. If you have a book that you want to add to the library, talk to your supervisor about purchasing it + adding to the library. Once you do let the team know it's available to them!

**Note**: We may technically be breaking DRM by sharing books this way. Please do not share these outside of Adapt

## New Purchases

Talk to your supervisor if you're interested in purchasing new learning materials. This could be anything from a new book, to an online course, or even attending a conference you're interested in. As long as it's related to the business we will do our best to purchase it for you, resources permitting.
