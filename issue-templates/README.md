# Issue Templates


The following templates should be added to project repositories if possible, in
order to codify our practices around describing issues, pull requests, or
processes like deployment.  These are good starting places, but they can
always be updated to suit the project.


 * [Adding issue templates in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository).
   E.g. place `issue_template.md` and `pull_request_template.md` at `/.github`
   on the repository.
 * [Adding issue templates in GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html)
