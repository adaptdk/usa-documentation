## For Participants

We expect the following from standup participants:

* Be on time
* Arrive to the meeting prepared to answer the following 3 questions:
  * What have you accomplished since the last meeting?
  * What will you be working on until the next meeting?
  * What blockers do you have?
* If there is something that may take some time to discuss, request and
  after-meeting with only the needed people, instead of trying to approach it
  there.

Pretty simple.

## For Facilitators

* Standup meetings should be scheduled for 15 minutes
* Put the 3 questions that everyone is expected to answer in the meeting invite
* Share your screen, with following windows open:
  * Speaker order for that meeting. Consider randomizing the order with [a tool like this](https://www.browserling.com/tools/random-lines?input=Jack%0AJill%0ADiane) (notice the names in the URL, which allow you to re-use the link without typing in everyone's name again)
  * Kanban board for the current sprint, filtered by the person that's currently speaking
* Primary goals of a standup
  * **Provide a shared understanding of project goals:** Even if everyone is on the same page at the beginning of a project, understanding tends to shift / deteriorate over time. Standup meetings provide small course corrections which ensure we maintain alignment.
  * **Allow space for sharing problems & solutions:** If a team member is having trouble with an issue, this is a great time for other team members to offer solutions. Typically, these solutions should be discussed outside the standup, but this is a good space to identify those follow up discussions.
  * **Foster team identity:** Working with remote teams can be isolating / lonely sometimes. This is a good opportunity to foster team identity so that we can unite around a shared goal (delivering high quality software for our customers)
* Consider using non-live interaction instead of live meetings, setting a clear
  timeline for them to be produced by the team.
  This approach can help to decrease interruptions, especially if more than one
  project is being worked at a time.
  An example to implement this is to use a slack channel as the place to report
  to, set a reminder to trigger at the needed pace, and suggest to use a thread
  to capture replies.
